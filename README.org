#+begin_quote
Clapt, having been clapt into existence, is the apt CL package manager.

* Clapt
A package managing /client/. Keep a list of packages efficiently installed.
* Install
We need to know which packages are needed, and whether they are from quicklisp.
1. =(asdf:load-system :clapt)=
2. =(clapt:install)=. SBCL will save and die.
By default clapt will try to overwrite your installed core file. This
may require root access on your system; alternatively, try
=(clapt:install :core "path-to-your-core")= for a different core.
* Adding packages
Call =clapt:add= with the manager and packages. Current managers are =:asdf= and
=:quicklisp=.
* Updating packages
#+begin_src common-lisp :tangle no
(clapt:update)
#+end_src

* Rationale
Loading a lot of packages from a script is slow, and having to reload the image
manually on every update is too laborious. A simple package manager
* Alternatives
- Just write an init script for your lisp like:
#+begin_src common-lisp :tangle no
(ql:quickload :petalisp)
(qul:quickload :coleslaw)
;;; ... etc.
#+end_src
This is fine if the number of packages is low. Eventually it can start to take
too long.
- Store your core manually.
  1. Write a script like the one above.
  2. =load= it.
  3. Save your core. SBCL has =sb-ext:save-lisp-and-die= for this.
  4. Start your lisp with =sbcl --core "path/to/core"= or similar.
This is essentially what this script does, but lacks backups and needs to be
done every time the lisp is updated.
- clpm is another attempt at the same, and has the benefit of removing itself
  from the core. It has dependencies, and is a bit involved to use.
